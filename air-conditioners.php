                                <h2>Is it time for a new air conditioner?</h2>

                                <p>When summer temperatures and humidity arrive in Michigan, you need an air conditioner
                                    that’s ready to perform to your expectations. If your current central air system
                                    isn’t up to the task, it’s time to upgrade. 911 Mechanical installs advanced,
                                    affordable, energy-efficient, and high-performance air conditioners and cooling
                                    systems for both homes and businesses.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Our comfort designers will tailor your needs to the perfect-sized system for your

                                <h2>So What Does the SEER Rating of an AC system Mean?</h2>

                                <p>SEER stands for "Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio," and it is a measure of the
                                    cooling output of an air conditioning system over a typical cooling season, divided
                                    by the amount of energy consumed in watt-hours.
                                    season.</p>
                                <br>


                                <h2>Variable-Capacity AC Compressor</h2>

                                <p>The Variable-capacity compressor also called Variable Speed is currently our most
                                    efficient and quietest option. It can operate at various speeds depending on the
                                    cooling requirements, ranging from 35-100%. Compared to two-stage systems, it offers
                                    a wider range of speeds, enabling the air conditioning to maintain lower speeds for
                                    longer durations while providing the option for higher speeds when the outdoor
                                    temperature rises. As a result, variable-speed AC systems run continuously without
                                    frequent on/off cycles and only at the required speed to keep you comfortable,
                                    making them the most energy-efficient among the three types of AC systems.</p>


                                <h2>Two-Stage / Multi Stage AC Compressor</h2>
                                <p>The two-stage AC compressor operates at two levels: high for extremely hot summer
                                    days and low for milder summer days. With a two-stage AC unit, you essentially get
                                    two units for the price of one. On days with moderate temperatures, the compressor
                                    initially runs at 70%, and if it fails to cool the house to the desired level, it
                                    moves to 100%. Since the low setting is adequate for cooling homes 80% of the time,
                                    a two-stage unit operates for more extended periods, resulting in a more uniform
                                    indoor air temperature. Compared to a single-stage compressor, the two-stage
                                    compressor is more efficient because it doesn't cycle on and off as frequently,
                                    reducing wear and tear. Moreover, the two-stage system removes twice as much
                                    humidity as the single-stage system because it operates at the lower level for an
                                    extended period.</p>

                                <h2>Single-Stage AC Compressor</h2>
                                <p>A single-stage AC compressor functions at a constant full-cold speed, with the
                                    thermostat controlling the home's temperature by turning the AC system and
                                    compressor on and off. In Michigan, most homes with central air conditioning use a
                                    single-stage compressor, which has been the standard for several decades. The latest
                                    single-stage models feature cutting-edge technology, making them considerably more
                                    energy-efficient than their older counterparts, which had much lower SEER ratings.
                                </p>
