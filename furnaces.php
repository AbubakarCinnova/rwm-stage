                                <br>

                                <p>When you own a home, one of the most challenging choices you'll face regarding your
                                    furnace is determining when it's necessary to replace your heating system. If you're
                                    conducting online research or have come across discussions on variable speed
                                    heating, single-stage, two-stage, and modulating gas valves, as well as AFUE
                                    ratings, allow us to assist you by providing explanations for these furnace systems
                                    and relevant terminology.</p>


                                <h2>Furnace Efficiency Rating AFUE</h2>
                                <p>AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) measures the efficiency of modern furnaces
                                    by comparing the furnace's annual heat output to its total fossil fuel consumption.
                                    A furnace with a 99 AFUE rating returns 99 cents of heat per dollar spent, while 1
                                    cent is lost. The AFUE rating doesn't include heat loss through ducts. </p>

                                <h2>Variable Capacity Furnaces also called Modulating Gas Furnaces</h2>
                                <p>A variable capacity furnace, also known as a modulating gas furnace, is an advanced
                                    type of heating system that adjusts its output between 35% and 100% depending on the
                                    heating demand. This allows it to use only the amount of fuel necessary to maintain
                                    the desired temperature. These furnaces are among the most energy-efficient on the
                                    market, with an efficiency rating of 99%.</p>

                                <h2>Two Stage Furnace</h2>
                                <p>A two-stage furnace has two heat output levels, one for mild and one for cold
                                    weather. It saves energy and reduces noise by running at a lower speed during mild
                                    weather, and provides more heat during cold days by running at full capacity. This
                                    leads to energy savings and better comfort. Though it has a higher initial cost, it
                                    saves on monthly heating bills.</p>

                                <h2>Variable Speed Furnace</h2>
                                <p>A variable-speed furnace is a type of heating system that uses a variable-speed
                                    blower motor to adjust the airflow through the furnace. This allows the furnace to
                                    adjust the fan speed based on heating demand, resulting in better temperature
                                    control, improved indoor air quality, and consistent temperature, and reduces the
                                    number of times the furnace has to cycle on and off. This makes it more energy
                                    efficient and cost-effective than traditional, fixed-speed furnaces.</p>

                                <h2>Single Stage Furnaces</h2>
                                <p>The single-stage furnace is the most basic and affordable option among all types of
                                    furnaces. It is also the simplest in terms of technology. However, this simplicity
                                    comes at a cost of energy efficiency, resulting in higher monthly utility bills.
                                    This is because a single-stage furnace uses the same flame size to produce heat,
                                    regardless of the temperature inside or outside.</p>
