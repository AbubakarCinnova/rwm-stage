                                        <p>The U.S. EPA has estimated that indoor air levels of pollutants may be 2 to 5
                                            times - and occasionally more than 100 times - higher than outdoor air
                                            pollutant levels. Indoor air pollutants have been ranked among the top five
                                            environmental risks to public health. The problems they cause can be subtle
                                            and do not always produce easily recognized or immediate impacts on health.
                                            (source U.S. E.P.A.) The average adult at rest inhales and exhales around 7
                                            or 8 liters of air per minute. That totals to be around 11,000 liters of air
                                            (388 cubic feet) in a day.
