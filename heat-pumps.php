                                <p><strong>
                                        A Dual-Function Heating and Cooling Solution for Michigan Homes
                                    </strong></p>


                                <p>A heat pump is a dual-function system that can both heat and cool a home, making it a
                                    versatile option for homeowners in Michigan. Combining a heat pump with a furnace
                                    creates a dual fuel system that ensures year-round comfort, with the heat pump
                                    operating
                                    as an air conditioner in summer and extracting heat from the outdoor air and
                                    transferring it inside in winter.</p>



                                <p>For optimal performance, a heat pump is most effective when temperatures are above 30
                                    degrees Fahrenheit, and a furnace can take over in colder weather. Homeowners in
                                    Michigan may need a supplemental heating source when temperatures drop
                                    significantly.
                                    However, combining a Lennox or Carrier heat pump with an efficient furnace can
                                    create an
                                    energy-saving dual-fuel system that reduces gas fuel consumption and ensures maximum
                                    comfort on extra-cold days.</p>



                                <p>Energy efficiency is affected by a variety of factors, including the design, size,
                                    and
                                    maintenance of the HVAC system, climate, building insulation, and occupants'
                                    behavior.
                                    Our comfort designers can conduct proper analysis and load calculations to help in
                                    selecting the most suitable HVAC system for a home or business.</p>
