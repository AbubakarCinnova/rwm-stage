                                <p><strong>
                                        A Dual-Function Heating and Cooling Solution for Michigan Homes
                                    </strong></p>


                                <p>A heat pump is a dual-function system that can both heat and cool a home, making it a versatile option for homeowners in Indiana. Combining a heat pump with a furnace creates a dual fuel system that ensures year-round comfort, with the heat pump operating as an air conditioner in summer and extracting heat from the outdoor air and transferring it inside in winter. </p>



                                <p>For optimal performance, a heat pump is most effective when temperatures are above 30 degrees Fahrenheit, and a furnace can take over in colder weather. Homeowners in Indiana may need a supplemental heating source when temperatures drop significantly. However, combining a Lennox heat pump with an efficient furnace can create an energy-saving dual-fuel system that reduces gas fuel consumption and ensures maximum comfort on extra-cold days. </p>



                                <p>Energy efficiency is affected by a variety of factors, including the design, size, and maintenance of the HVAC system, climate, building insulation, and occupants' behavior. Our comfort designers can conduct proper analysis and load calculations to help in selecting the most suitable HVAC system for a home or business.</p>



                                <p>Ecofriendly Heating and Cooling is actively working with customers to get the maximum credit on their new heat pump installations by utilizing the Federal Inflation Reduction Act as well as local Utility Rebates and manufacturer rebates. </p>
