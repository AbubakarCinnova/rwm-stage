                                <h1>Annual V.I.P Maintenance Program</h1>
                                <p>As your Heating and Cooling equipment ages, the more valuable a maintenance program becomes.  The savings from one major repair could save you more than the service agreement itself.  Regular service of your equipment is like changing the oil in your vehicle.  You can save thousands in energy costs and future repairs, as well as extend the life of your HVAC system. 
                                </p>


                                <h2>Top Priority Status</h2>

                                <p>You are a Ecofriendly Mechanical VIP customer when you have a member of the Annual V.I.P
                                    Maintenance Program. That means when you need service, you get it NOW - no lengthy
                                    waiting when your system is out of order. Ecofriendly Mechanical has emergency service
                                    available
                                    24 hours per day, every day of the week.</p>



                                <h2>Longer Equipment Life</h2>

                                <p>With the special care you receive with the V.I.P Maintenance Program, your heating and cooling equipment will last longer and run more efficiently.</p>



                                <h2>Energy Savings</h2>

                                <p>The money you'll save by maintaining your equipment in top running order with a VIP
                                    Maintenance Program membership will add up to big savings on your heating and
                                    cooling
                                    costs.</p>



                                <h2>Fulfillment of Warranty Requirements</h2>
                                <p>If your HVAC components are under warranty, you should know that most manufacturers require evidence of annual maintenance to pay a claim. An investment in regular maintenance is essentially giving you an insurance policy. If something malfunctions that are covered under warranty, youâ€™ll be able to file your claim with more confidence and ease with evidence of annual maintenance.</p>



                                <h2>What's Included?</h2>
                                <p> Your EcoShield Service Plan agreement includes priority scheduling, discounts on service calls, and protection for your HVAC equipment. Two Tune-ups per year, one in the early fall for the furnace and one in the Spring for the AC or heat pump.
<br>Tank water heater or tankless water heater inspection is included.</p>
