                                <h1>Annual EcoShield Service Plan </h1>
                                <p>As your Heating and Cooling equipment ages, the more valuable a maintenance program
                                    becomes. The savings from one major repair could save you more than the service
                                    agreement itself. Regular service of your equipment is like changing the oil in your
                                    vehicle. You can save thousands in energy costs and future repairs, as well as
                                    extend the life of your HVAC system.
                                </p>


                                <h2>Top Priority Status</h2>

                                <p>You are an Ecofriendly Mechanical preferred customer when you are a member of the
                                    Annual EcoShield Service Plan. That means when you need service, you get priority

                                    every day of the week.</p>



                                <h2>Longer Equipment Life</h2>

                                <p>With the special care, you receive with the EcoShield Service Plan, your heating and
                                    cooling equipment will last longer and run more efficiently.

                                </p>


                                <h2>Energy Savings</h2>

                                <p>The money you'll save by maintaining your equipment in top running order with an
                                    EcoShield Service Plan membership will add up to big savings on your heating and
                                    cooling costs.

                                <h2>Fulfillment of Warranty Requirements</h2>
                                <p>If your HVAC components are under warranty, you should know that most manufacturers
                                    require evidence of annual maintenance to pay a claim. An investment in regular
                                    maintenance is essentially giving you an insurance policy. If something malfunctions
                                    that are covered under warranty, youâ€™ll be able to file your claim with more
                                    confidence and ease with evidence of annual maintenance.

                                </p>
