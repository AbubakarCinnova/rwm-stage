                                <p><strong>We provide professional services for both traditional tanked water heaters and tankless water heaters in the Bloomington area.</strong></p>
                                <p>When it comes to your water heater, it's essential to rely on an expert to ensure optimal performance and efficiency. Whether you're considering the replacement of a traditional tanked water heater or exploring the option of a tankless water heater, Ecofriendly Mechanical is the ideal company for you. We specialize in matching you with a water heater that perfectly aligns with your hot water requirements, offering the right capacity, energy efficiency, and price to meet your needs.</p>

                                <h2>What Is A Tankless Water Heater?</h2>
                                <p>Conventional water heaters typically store a significant volume of water at a consistently heated temperature in a storage tank. This results in high energy consumption, particularly during periods when hot water isn't required. On the other hand, a tankless water heater heats water on demand, providing hot water only when needed. By operating solely during active use, it effectively reduces energy consumption, leading to cost savings on home energy expenses. Additionally, opting for a tankless water heater is an environmentally friendly choice for your home.</p>

                                <h2>Endless Hot Water</h2>
                                <p>A tankless water heater provides an endless supply of hot water as it heats water on demand. It is an excellent solution for homes with larger hot water needs, such as those with a tub, spa, or pool, as well as for large families or bigger homes. If you currently have a 40-gallon or larger tank and are considering an upgrade, we highly recommend considering a tankless water heater. Our team at Ecofriendly Mechanical can send a service technician to your home or business to conduct an inspection and provide you with detailed cost estimates for installing a new tankless water system.</p>
                                <p>Compared to conventional tanked water heaters, tankless water heaters offer the advantage of never running out of hot water. With traditional water heaters, once you deplete the hot water supply, you must wait for the entire tank to reheat. In contrast, tankless water heaters heat water instantly as it is needed. The size of a tankless water heater is determined based on the flow rate and hot water usage in a home. Our knowledgeable technicians will ensure the perfect sizing of the tankless water heater for your home, guaranteeing an endless supply of hot water.</p>
