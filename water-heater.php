                                    water heaters</h2>

                                <h2>What Is A Tankless Water Heater?</h2>
                                <p>Most traditional water heaters maintain a large amount of water at a constant heated
                                    temperature stored in a holding tank. This consumes a great deal of energy during
                                    periods of time when you don't need hot water. A tankless water heater only heats
                                    water when you need it. Since it only consumes energy when being actively used, it
                                    saves you on your home energy costs and is an environmentally friendly option for
                                    your home.</p>

                                <h2>Endless Hot Water</h2>
                                <p>A tankless water heater is able to heat water on demand, the hot water never runs out. Tankless systems are usually good solutions for homes with a tub or spa or pool. Especially large families, or bigger homes with higher hot water demands. If you currently have a 40-gallon or higher-gallon tank and plan to upgrade, we strongly suggest that you consider the Tankless Water Heater as an option. A service technician from Ecofriendly is happy to come to your home or business, provide an inspection, and let you know the costs associated with the installation of a new tankless water system.</p>
                                <p>Tankless water heaters offer a limitless supply of hot water when compared to the
                                    capacity of conventional tanked water heaters because with a traditional water
                                    heater, once you are out of hot water, you have to wait for the whole tank to
                                    reheat. With a tankless water heater, the water is heated instantly when needed.
                                    Tankless water heaters are sized based on flow rate and usage of hot water in a
                                    home. Our friendly technicians will be able to size the perfect tankless for your
                                    home so you will have endless hot water.</p>
